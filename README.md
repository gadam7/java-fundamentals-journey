# Java Fundamentals Journey

A comprehensive learning path for mastering Java fundamentals through hands-on projects and exercises.

## Learning Phases

### Phase 1: Java Basics ✅ (COMPLETED)
**Status:** Complete  
**Completion Date:** January 5, 2026

Core concepts covered:
- ✅ Variables and Data Types
- ✅ Operators and Expressions
- ✅ Control Flow (if/else, switch, loops)
- ✅ Methods and Functions
- ✅ Arrays and Basic Collections

**Projects Completed:**
- Simple Calculator
- Number Guessing Game
- Basic Array Operations

---

### Phase 2: Object-Oriented Programming (In Progress)
**Status:** Active  
**Focus:** Building a Progressive Todo List Application

#### Progressive Todo List Project

A multi-stage project designed to progressively introduce OOP concepts:

**Stage 1: Basic Task Management**
- Create Task class with properties (title, description, status)
- Implement basic CRUD operations
- Use ArrayList for task storage
- Practice encapsulation with getters/setters

**Stage 2: Enhanced Features**
- Add priority levels and due dates
- Implement task categories
- Create TaskManager class for business logic
- Practice class relationships and composition

**Stage 3: Advanced OOP Concepts**
- Implement interfaces (Comparable, Serializable)
- Add inheritance (different task types)
- Use polymorphism for task behaviors
- Implement design patterns (Factory, Observer)

**Stage 4: Persistence & UI**
- File I/O for saving/loading tasks
- Exception handling
- Simple console-based menu system
- Input validation and error handling

**Current Stage:** Stage 1 - Basic Task Management

---

### Phase 3: Advanced Topics (Upcoming)
- Collections Framework (deep dive)
- Generics
- Exception Handling (advanced)
- File I/O and Serialization
- Basic Multithreading

### Phase 4: Modern Java Features (Planned)
- Streams and Lambda Expressions
- Optional and Functional Interfaces
- Modern Java APIs
- Best Practices and Design Patterns
